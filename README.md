# Birthday Paradox Simulation ðŸŽ‚

This repository contains Python scripts to simulate and analyze the Birthday Paradox. 

The Birthday Paradox refers to the counterintuitive probability that in a group of 

relatively few people, it's likely that at least two individuals share the same birthday.

## birthday_paradox_simulation.py
### Purpose

This script calculates the theoretical probability of the Birthday Paradox based on mathematical formulas. 

It takes the number of people as input and outputs the calculated probability.

---

### How to use
Run the script and input the number of people when prompted. 

The script will run simulations and plot the probability of a birthday match for different group sizes.

## birthday_paradox_visualization.py
### Purpose

This script simulates the Birthday Paradox through random simulations. 

It generates random birthdays for a specified number of people and checks if there are any shared birthdays. 

The script outputs the probability of a birthday match based on the simulations.

---

### How to use

Run the script, and it will run simulations and plot the probability of a birthday match for different group sizes.

---

### Visualization

The script includes a visualization of the simulation results using Matplotlib. 

The x-axis represents the number of people in the group, and the y-axis represents the probability of a birthday match.
